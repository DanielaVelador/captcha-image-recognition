In this project, I aimed to accurately recognize characters from CAPTCHA images. I utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction and implemented Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks as part of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for sequence prediction. Additionally, I employed ResNet to enhance the model's ability to learn complex patterns, which significantly improved the accuracy of character recognition.
